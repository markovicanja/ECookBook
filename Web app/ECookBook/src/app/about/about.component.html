                            Home cooks are our heroes—it's as simple as that. ECookBook is a community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will dedicate the weekend to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed brownies for a decadent weeknight dessert. The entertainers who just want a solid snack spread, without tons of dirty dishes at the end of the night.
                        </p>
                        <p id="about-p2">
                            Most importantly, ECookBook connects home cooks with their greatest sources of inspiration — other home cooks. We're the world's leading digital food brand, and that inspires us to do everything possible to keep our community connected. Sixty-million home cooks deserve no less.

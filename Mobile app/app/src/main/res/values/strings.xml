    <string name="about_us_text">\t\t\t\tHome cooks are our heroes—it\'s as simple as that. ECookBook is a community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will dedicate the weekend to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed brownies for a decadent weeknight dessert. The entertainers who just want a solid snack spread, without tons of dirty dishes at the end of the night. \n\t\t\t\tMost importantly, ECookBook connects home cooks with their greatest sources of inspiration — other home cooks. We\'re the world\'s leading digital food brand, and that inspires us to do everything possible to keep our community connected. </string>
